Data Sources
The genetic and antibiotic resistance data used in this project were obtained from publicly available databases and literature sources. 

Visualizations
The antimicrobial resistance profiles of the five Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were visualized using the following method:
Bar Charts: Bar charts were generated to illustrate the presence or absence of resistance across different antibiotic classes.

Results and Discussion
The analysis revealed distinct patterns in antimicrobial resistance among the Klebsiella strains:

Strain 1: Showed resistance to ciprofloxacin (Quinolone, Match = 2), amoxicillin (Beta-lactam, Match = 2), ampicillin (Beta-lactam, Match = 2), piperacillin (Beta-lactam, Match = 2), ticarcillin (Beta-lactam, Match = 2), and cephalothin (Beta-lactam, Match = 2).

Strain 2: Exhibited susceptibility across all tested antibiotics with no observed resistance.

Strain 3: Showed resistance to fosfomycin (Fosfomycin, Match = 3).

Strain 4: Exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol (Amphenicol, Match = 2).

Strain 5: Showed resistance to trimethoprim (Folate pathway antagonist, Match = 2).

Conclusion
In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance profiles across five Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. The findings highlight distinct patterns of resistance and susceptibility to various antibiotics, underscoring the variability within this pathogen species.

Our analysis revealed that:

Strain 1 demonstrated resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics, including amoxicillin and ampicillin, mediated by the blaSHV-33 gene.
Strain 2 exhibited susceptibility to a broad range of antibiotics, showing no resistance to any tested antimicrobial agents.
Strain 3 displayed resistance to fluoroquinolones and quinolones, attributed to genetic determinants such as OqxB and OqxA.
Strain 4 showed resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim, indicative of acquired mechanisms in resistance.
Strain 5 was found to be resistant to cephalosporins and carbapenems, posing challenges in treatment options.
The variability in resistance profiles among these strains underscores the importance of surveillance and tailored treatment strategies in combating Klebsiella infections. By understanding the genetic basis of resistance, healthcare providers can make informed decisions to optimize antibiotic therapies and mitigate the spread of resistant strains.

Moving forward, continued monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in Klebsiella strains is crucial to adapt treatment protocols and preserve the efficacy of existing antibiotics. Further research into the mechanisms of resistance and the development of novel therapeutic approaches are essential in addressing this pressing public health concern.
